This is the bot powering the Twitter account [@muslimbanca9](https://www.twitter.com/muslimbanca9), which monitors changes to the [Ninth Circuit's public docket mirror](http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/content/view.php?pk_id=0000000860) for State of Washington and State of Minnesota v. Trump, one of the legal challenges to Trump's immigration executive order.

Triggered by a cron job, it notes changes to that docket table, uploads any new PDFs to DocumentCloud, and then tweets about those changes. All uploads are placed in the same [DocumentCloud project](https://www.documentcloud.org/search/projectid:31541-Washington-v-Trump-Muslim-Ban-9th-Circuit).
